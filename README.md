# blockfinder

A Gatt tree in the CLI, for managing complex projects without the pressure of
timeframes or deadlines. Simply define a project, and blockfinder will locate
either blocking or actionable tasks at every step.

This project is intended for people who are working on smaller projects. It
lacks the features necessary to assign work to specific teams, or to schedule
tasks. The design goal here is to simply organize tasks to reduce confusion
over what to do next, and to track which steps or branches arethe biggest
time-wasters as the project drags on.

## What is a Gatt tree?

A Gatt tree is a way of organizing goals or tasks on a project. A task may
depend on several sub-tasks, which each may also have sub-tasks, and so on.
Turtles all the way down. So how do you locate items that have no
dependencies, and thus, can be completed? You use graph theory and recursion!
